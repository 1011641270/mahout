<DIV>The Bayes example package provides some helper classes for training the Naive Bayes classifier on the Twenty Newsgroups
  data.  See {@link org.apache.mahout.classifier.bayes.TrainTwentyNewsgroups} for details on running the trainer.  See
  {@link org.apache.mahout.classifier.bayes.PrepareTwentyNewsgroups} for details on formatting the Twenty Newsgroups data
  properly for the training.
</DIV>
<div>
  The easiest way to prepare the data is to use the ant task in core/build.xml:
  <pre>
    ant extract-20news-18828
  </pre>
  This runs the arg line:
  <pre>
    -p ${working.dir}/20news-18828/ -o ${working.dir}/20news-18828-collapse -a ${analyzer} -c UTF-8
  </pre>
